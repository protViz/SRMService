This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(bookdown)
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


So here we do it again.
Here's the cross-ref: \@ref(fig:cars-fig) and the question would be why it is not working

Here's the figure:

```{r cars-fig, fig.cap = 'Here is a plot about cars'}
plot(cars)
```
